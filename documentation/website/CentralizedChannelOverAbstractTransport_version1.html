<h2>Version 1: Centralized Channel Over TCP Transport2 Component</h2>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal"><FONT SIZE=3> The component is configured to use simple transport like Tcp Transport2 to build centralized server with a checkpointed communication channel (CC), that can accept connections from CC clients. The server can be configured to listen on a know port by passing value to the argument of TcpTransport2_ component. Clients can connect to the server at this port. In version 1 of the component, the server has its own checkpointed component from which it gets the latest checkpoint when the server gets a new client connection. This checkpointed component at server side is of the same type as that at the client side. The server relays messages to everyone connected. 
<h4><b>Example</b></h4>
CentalizedChannelOverAbstractTransportServer_1.liveobject is the server object and CentalizedChannelOverAbstractTransportClient_1.liveobjects is the client object.
&ldquo;CentalizedChannelOverAbstractTransport&rdquo; component uses TcpTransport2_ component to abstract the TCP connection functionality.  TcpTransport2_ typical accept ip:port combinations, but also allows you to specify a subnet you wish to listen on.  For our purposes, anything will do, so we listen on 0.0.0.0/0:42424 (any subnet).  The port is this case is 42424.
Connect the same checkpointed componented that is connected at the client end. In this example, &ldquo;Text&rdquo; component is connected to &ldquo;CentalizedChannelOverAbstractTransport&rdquo; component for checkpointing. Whenever server gets new connections it ask for checkpoint from "Text" component and relays it to the new connecting client.

&ldquo;CentalizedChannelOverAbstractTransportClient1_&rdquo; component also uses TcpTransport2_ component to abstract the TCP connection functionality. In this example, &ldquo;Text&rdquo; component is used to send user messages to the server and to display all the messages received back from the server.

<OL>
<LI> Start single instance of CentalizedChannelOverAbstractTransportServer_1.liveobject (server) object.
<LI> Open multiple instances of CentalizedChannelOverAbstractTransportClient_1.liveobjects (client) object.
<LI> Message typed in client's Text component is relayed to the server. The server then relays the message to all the other clients connected.
<LI> Close all the instances of the client.
<LI> Open new clients. The checkpointed state will be relayed to the new clients. This state is obtained from the checkpointed component connected at the server end.
</OL>
