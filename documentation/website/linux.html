<h1>Live Distributed Objects</h1>
<h2>Linux Distribution</h2>
<h3>0. Introduction</h3>
<p>This document describes how to install the liveobjects-linux distribution on 
your system, as well as any other pertinent information for trying to experiment 
with this release of liveobjects.&nbsp; You should know that Linux support of 
liveobjects is 100% experimental, and only a fraction of the features in the 
full liveobjects distribution are available for use here.&nbsp; This stems from 
a variety of reasons, the biggest being the lack of .NET library availability on 
Linux, the next biggest being that the Mono project is a community run project 
(through supported financially by Novell) and as such is always finding and 
fixing bugs.&nbsp; Liveobjects tends to use whatever cutting edge language and 
library features are offered by .NET, so we find ourselves hitting bugs with the 
newer and cooler features of .NET, but all of the core functionality of 
Liveobjects is already functional in this release.&nbsp; We plan for upcoming 
releases to include a port of the Quick Silver Messenger Service.</p>
<h2>Install Liveobjects-Linux</h2>
<h3>1. Prerequisites</h3>
<p>You need a version of mono that has various experimental libraries such as 
System.ServiceModel and System.Runtime.Serialization, and in general these are 
not included by default by most mainstream Linux distributions (Ubuntu/Debian in 
particular).&nbsp; Check with your chosen distribution&#39;s packages website to 
learn whether these .dll&#39;s are available from any package.&nbsp; In Ubuntu they 
are not, so we describe the basic instructions for building yourself a mono 
install that does use these experimental libraries.&nbsp; In order to build 
mono, first you&#39;ll need a build environment, specifically these packages:</p>
<ul>
	<li>subversion</li>
	<li>mono-devel</li>
	<li>autoconf</li>
	<li>libtool</li>
	<li>automake</li>
	<li>bison</li>
	<li>gettext</li>
	<li>gcc/g++ and associated dependencies (in Ubuntu these can be installed 
	with the build-essential package)</li>
</ul>
<p>To install these packages in Ubuntu:</p>
<pre>apt-get install subversion mono-devel autoconf libtool automake bison gettext build-essential</pre>
<h3>2. Compiling from SVN</h3>
<p>For the latest instructions on how to compile mono from subversion, check
<a href="http://mono-project.com/Compiling_Mono_From_SVN">
http://mono-project.com/Compiling_Mono_From_SVN</a></p>
<p>The abridged instructions follow:</p>
<pre>$ svn co http://anonsvn.mono-project.com/source/trunk/mono
$ svn co http://anonsvn.mono-project.com/source/trunk/mcs
$ svn co http://anonsvn.mono-project.com/source/trunk/libgdiplus
$ svn co svn://anonsvn.mono-project.com/source/trunk/olive 
$ cd mono
$ ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr/local
$ make
$ make install</pre>
<p>Mono compilation has a lot of neat features, but the defaults should set you 
up just fine.&nbsp; If you are curious, you should read
<a href="http://mono-project.com/Advanced_Mono_Compile_Options">
http://mono-project.com/Advanced_Mono_Compile_Options</a> and
<a href="http://mono-project.com/Unsupported_Advanced_Mono_Compile_Options">
http://mono-project.com/Unsupported_Advanced_Mono_Compile_Options</a></p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE : You must build the olive package as well, which is 
not defaultly recommended by the linked guide, so make sure to check out the 
olive package <span class="style1">BEFORE</span> building Mono!</strong></p>
<h3>3. Install liveobjects (optional)</h3>
<p>The install-sh script include in this distribution copies all relevant files 
to your system, and attempts to associate the .liveobject file extension with 
the liveobjects runtime.&nbsp; You should note you do not need to install 
liveobjects, you can start running it from the directory created by the tarball.&nbsp; 
To use the installer:</p>
<pre>./install-sh --target=/path/to/install/dir </pre>
<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
