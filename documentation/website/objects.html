<h3><a name="understanding"></a>Understanding Live Objects</h3>
<p><strong><a name="definitions"></a>Definitions</strong></p>
<p>A <span class="style1">live object</span> is a single instance of a 
distributed protocol running on some set of machines, and the
<span class="style1">live object&#39;s protocol</span> is the protocol itself, i.e. 
a set of instructions that prescribes what each of the machines on which the 
object runs should do. The instructions may involve sending packets across the 
network, or interacting with the user, other applications or the operating 
system. The instructions either take the form of, or can be compiled down to 
executable code. An instance of such code running on a particular machine is 
called a <span class="style1">live object&#39;s proxy</span>. Each live object is 
thus executed by a set of its proxies that follow its protocol. To run a live 
object, a machine must have the description of its protocol. A description of a 
protocol expressed in a standard, uniform manner prescribed by the live objects 
runtime is called a <span class="style1">live object reference</span>. Any 
machine that has a live object reference can extract the protocol description 
from it, and can instantiate the proxy that will run locally on the machine. We 
will refer to this process as <span class="style1">dereferencing</span> a live 
object&#39;s reference. To <span class="style1">deploy</span> a live object, it is 
thus sufficient to create a reference and distribute it to all machines on which 
the object needs to run.</p>
<p>A <span class="style1">live object class</span> determines the way a live 
object interacts with the external world. The class defines a number of
<span class="style1">endpoints</span>, which represent event channels. Each 
proxy of the object maintains a copy of each endpoint defined by the object&#39;s 
class, and uses it to communicate with the proxies of other objects. The 
endpoints come in different flavors. An <span class="style1">endpoint class</span> 
determines the types of events that an object can send or receive through an 
endpoint of this class, and may place additional constraints on these events, 
e.g. in terms of their temporal patterns. Object classes and endpoint classes 
can be thought of as typed contracts, an equivalent of interfaces in an 
object-oriented programming language.</p>
<p>The above description is very brief, and will undoubtedly leave the reader 
confused. We encourage the reader to skim over the first few pages of the 
following paper to develop better intuition. The paper is easy to follow, and 
has a number of examples, and there is perhaps not much point duplicating its 
contents. </p>

</p>
<p>As explained in the preceding section, a live object runs when a set of 
machines uses its reference to create proxies that will execute the object&#39;s 
protocol. In our platform, object references are encoded in the XML format, in 
files with the &quot;.liveobject&quot; extension. We have created a file association for 
the &quot;.liveobject&quot; extension, so that in order to launch a live object proxy, it 
is enough to double-click a &quot;.liveobject&quot; file containing the object&#39;s reference 
or type in the file name in Command Prompt and press ENTER, as shown below:</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="screenshot_006.gif" ></p>
<p>Either way, double-clicking a &quot;.liveobject&quot; file or executing it in a shell 
is merely a shortcut for invoking &quot;\bin\liveobejcts.exe&quot;, the live objects 
runtime, with the .liveobject file passed as an argument to it. Hence, the 
command above is equivalent to executing &quot;C:\liveobjects\bin\liveobjects.exe C:\liveobjects\examples\channels_server.liveobject&quot;. 
Indeed, if you open 
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/default.aspx">Process Explorer</a> to see the list of running processes, and 
enable the command line display (in menu &quot;View&quot;, &quot;Select Columns&quot;, choose column 
&quot;Command Line&quot;), you will see a line corresponding to exactly this invocation 
(the selected process in the picture below). </p>
<p class="style2"><img src="screenshot_007.gif" /></p>
<p>Each live object started by executing a &quot;.liveobject&quot; file will start in a 
separate process, so if you start multiple objects this way, you will see 
multiple processes in the view above. For debugging purposes, it is sometimes 
useful to know which process corresponds to which object. You can find that out 
by right-clicking on the process in Process Explorer and selecting &quot;Window&quot;, 
then &quot;Bring To Front&quot;, as shown below. This will highlight the corresponding 
window.</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="screenshot_008.gif" /></p>
<p>As you may have noticed, each live object process has its own application 
window. If the object has a user interface, the interface will fill the window. 
If it doesn&#39;t, as it is the case with the object used in this example, the 
window will simply display the name and type of the object, with the object 
running in the background. Pressing the &quot;OK&quot; button will immediately terminate 
the object (the button name is perhaps somewhat misleading, and we will fix that 
at some point, unfortunately the built-in modal system dialogs we&#39;re using for 
this purpose do not offer an easy way to customize this).</p>
<p>In general, a single live objects runtime will host multiple objects in the 
same &quot;liveobjects.exe&quot; process. This is the case when one object spawns another. 
Both objects then run in the same address space and share the same threads and 
other resources. You will see this on an example of a virtual desktop, which we 
will discuss shortly.</p>
<p>As you may have noticed, objects started so far were running in the context 
of the interactive user (as the terminal services session number and the user 
name in the above screenshots indicates). There is another way to start live 
objects, by hosting them in a service process. During the installation, we 
create a service &quot;Live Distributed Objects&quot;, by default stopped, and requiring 
manual start, either by using the &quot;Services&quot; tool from &quot;Administrative Tools&quot;, 
as shown below, or by executing &quot;net start &quot;Live Distributed Objects&quot;&quot; from 
command prompt (note the single quotation marks surrounding the service name).</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="screenshot_009.gif" width="801" height="215">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>The service executes the exact same process &quot;\bin\liveobjects.exe&quot;, only that 
it does so in a terminal services session 0 and under a Local System account (as 
you may verify in Process Explorer), it has no user interface, and does not have 
any arguments. When started in this mode, the runtime reads the contents of the 
folder &quot;\services&quot;, and executes all objects in this folder. All objects run in 
the same process, share resources, and are executed with Local System 
credentials. This makes it possible to use certain types of resources, such as 
e.g. create global shared memory regions, but it also carries a security risk, 
so only trusted objects should run as services, and it is best to secure the 
contents of this folder against writing, e.g. by making it read-only. </p>
<p>By default, we deploy a single service, a server for a trivial implementation 
of multicast over TCP that can be used for debugging simple objects that don&#39;t 
require high performance. By default, multicast is configured to use this 
server, so if you start any of the examples we provided that involve multicast, 
they will expect the local server to be running. It is possible to configure the 
system to use a server on a different machine, or to use another multicast 
platform, such as QSM or your custom solution. We will discuss this in another 
section.</p>
<p>To conclude this section, try running a desktop example: start the &quot;QuickSilver 
Live Objects service&quot;, and then double-click on the 
&quot;shared_desktop_1.liveobject&quot; file in the &quot;\examples&quot; folder. You should see a 
pair of &quot;liveobject.exe&quot; processes running, one under a Local System account, 
and one other a local user account.</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="screenshot_010.gif" width="952" height="148"></p>
<p>By double-clicking the services process and selecting the &quot;TCP/IP&quot; tab, you 
can verify that a TCP connection has been established between the two, as shown 
below. When objects fail to work, it is a good idea to double-check that network 
connectivity is an issue. At the very least, you should make sure that the 
default port 60000 is open in the firewall, that &quot;liveobjects.exe&quot; has a right 
to open new incoming and outgoing connections.</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="screenshot_011.gif" width="466" height="194"></p>
<p>Now, select &quot;shared_text_1.liveobject&quot;, as shown below, and drag it inside 
the area of the desktop object, as shown below. </p>
<p class="style2"><img src="screenshot_012.gif" > </p>
<p>You will see a text object is embedded in the desktop, but as you can verify 
in Process Explorer, no new &quot;liveobject.exe&quot; processes are created. In this 
case, both live objects, the desktop and the text object, run in the same 
process. They will also share the same connection that links them to the local 
multicast server.</p>
<p><strong><a name="internals"></a>Understanding the Internal Structure of Live 
Object References</strong></p>
<p>As already mentioned earlier, the &quot;.liveobject&quot; files are object references 
encoded in XML. While it is not necessary to edit these files by hand because we 
provide a visual designer for this purpose, it helps to understand how they are 
constructed. After opening one of these files, you will a structure similar to 
the following. </p>
<p class="style2"><img src="screenshot_013.gif" width="977" height="687"></p>
<p>At the root level, there is always a &quot;Root&quot; element, inside which we expect 
an &quot;&lt;Object&gt;&quot; section containing an object definition. In this example, the 
element representing the object definition is of type &quot;ReferenceObject&quot;, it has 
an identifier (the XML attribute &quot;id&quot;), a number of custom attributes (the 
&quot;&lt;Attribute&gt;&quot; elements in the &quot;&lt;Object&gt;&quot; element), and a few parameters (the 
&quot;&lt;Parameter&gt;&quot; elements). To make it clearer, we show the same XML below with the 
unnecessary details obscured.</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="screenshot_014.gif" width="978" height="173"></p>
<p>There are two categories of object definitions: &quot;ReferenceObject&quot; 
definitions, which simply point to a definition stored elsewhere, and &quot;CompositeObject&quot; 
definitions, which explicitly describe how the object is constructed out of its 
constituent parts, which presumable are more primitive objects. We will refer to 
objects described in these two ways as &quot;reference objects&quot; and &quot;composite 
objects&quot;, respectively. In this tutorial, we will focus on reference objects, 
because these are more common and seem to be more convenient to work with.</p>
<p>Reference objects come in three flavors. The first type is &quot;predefined&quot; 
objects, which we will also refer to as &quot;library&quot; objects. These are implemented 
in .NET libraries. Their code is either built into the live objects runtime, or 
is downloaded from elsewhere. The second type is &quot;repository&quot; objects. The 
definitions of these objects are stored inside other objects, which we will 
refer to as &quot;repositories&quot; or &quot;folders&quot;, so to instantiate those objects, the 
respective repositories need to be contacted first. Finally, there are also 
&quot;parameter&quot; objects, which are used in the definitions of composite objects to 
refer to the objects passed as parameters. In this section, we won&#39;t talk about 
the latter. We&#39;ll focus on predefined objects and repository objects, since 
these two will be easiest to define and work with.</p>
<p>Both types of objects we&#39;ll talk about, the predefined and repository ones, 
must have an identifier, passed as an XML attribute &quot;id&quot;. </p>
<p>In case of predefined objects, the identifier must have the following general 
form:</p>
<p class="style2"><span class="style3">namespaceid<span class="style4"><strong><span class="style5">`</span></strong></span>namespaceversion<strong><span class="style6">:</span></strong>componentid<strong><span class="style6">`</span></strong>componentversion</span> </p>
<p>The &quot;`&quot; (back-apostrophe) and &quot;:&quot; (colon) symbols we highlighted are 
separators. The &quot;libraryid&quot; and &quot;componentid&quot; are 128-bit hexadecimal numbers 
identifying the namespace in which the object is defined, and the specific 
component within this namespace. The &quot;namespaceversion&quot; and &quot;componentversion&quot; 
are the respective version numbers, encoded as 64-bit decimal numbers. The 
&quot;namespace&quot; here will typically refer to a .NET library, but a single namespace 
may also span across several libraries. We are assuming that namespace numbers 
would be reserved through some global directory in order to avoid collisions, 
although for the time being, numbers generated at random, e.g. using the &quot;Create 
GUID&quot; tool under &quot;Tools&quot; in Visual Studio, should be sufficient. The component 
numbers within a particular namespace can be anything. We assume that namespace 
and components are always backwards-compatible, i.e. a library or a component 
with a higher version number can perfectly replace one with a lower version 
number in any context. Accordingly, when the live objects runtime encounters a 
reference to a component or library with version N, it may choose to provide a 
component or a library with version M &gt; N. If backwards compatibility is 
impossible, one should simply generate new names.</p>
<p>Any of the four elements can be an empty string, in which case it is assumed 
to be &quot;0&quot;. Namespace &quot;0&quot; is reserved for the runtime. Hence, identifier 
&quot;C69D58A635524737981E4C8AB9279EDD&quot; is a shortcut for 
&quot;0`0:C69D58A635524737981E4C8AB9279EDD`0&quot;, which can be translated as &quot;any 
version of the component named C69D58A635524737981E4C8AB9279EDD from any version 
of the live objects runtime&quot;. One can skip the namespace specification and any 
of the version numbers. Hence for example, &quot;X:Y&quot; would translate to &quot;any version 
of component Y from namespace X&quot;, &quot;X`Y&quot; would translate to &quot;version Y or higher 
of component X from the live objects runtime&quot;, &quot;X:Y`Z&quot; would translate to 
&quot;version Z or higher of component Y from namespace X&quot;, and so on.</p>
<p>Objects defined in libraries can be parameterized, and the semantics of such 
objects is basically equivalent to templates in C++. The parameters can be type 
parameters, or concrete values. The values can, in particular, be references to 
other objects. The list of parameters is fixed for an object of a given type. </p>
<p>In this example, the predefined object named 
&quot;C69D58A635524737981E4C8AB9279EDD&quot;, which represents a visualization of a simple 
moving object in a 3-dimensional space, has two parameters, &quot;modelname&quot; and 
&quot;coordinates&quot;, shown in the expanded view below. The first is a simple string 
value that identifies a resource to be used as a texture to render, and the 
second is a reference to a live object that represents the stream of values 
encoding coordinates, velocity, orientation, and rotation in 3-dimensional 
space.</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="screenshot_015.gif" width="975" height="232"></p>
<p>The object reference for the &quot;coordinates&quot; parameter is encoded again as an 
XML element of type &quot;ReferenceObject&quot;. By now, you can see the recursive nature 
of these definitions: objects can take other objects as parameters, and the 
pattern can repeat in a cascading manner, much in the way function calls in an 
ordinary language can be nested.</p>
<p>The &quot;coordinates&quot; object has a typed parameter &quot;ValueClass&quot;. The object is 
actually a generic template that represents a stream of values obtained from a 
communication channel. Parameter &quot;ValueClass&quot; specifies the type of values 
carried in the channel, and parameter &quot;channel&quot; is a specific channel from which 
these values are retrieved. The type of values in the channel is encoded as an 
XML element of type &quot;ValueClass&quot;. This element resembles a &quot;ReferenceObject&quot; 
element. It has a single XML attribute &quot;id&quot;, formatted in exactly the same way 
as the identifier of a predefined object, that uniquely points to a specific 
version of a concrete value type defined in a specific namespace, implemented in 
a .NET library. In this case, namespace specification is missing, which means 
the type is predefined by the live objects runtime.</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="screenshot_016.gif" width="698" height="177"></p>
<p>Finally, let&#39;s look at the channel definition. Instead of a list of 
parameters, this object has a &quot;&lt;From&gt;&quot; element. This indicates that it is not a 
predefined object, but a repository object. The definition of this object is to 
be retrieved from another object, the &quot;repository&quot;. The definition of the 
repository itself is embedded here, that&#39;s what the &quot;from&quot; element is for. The 
&quot;id&quot; attribute, in this case, can be anything, it is used simply as a key to the 
repository. The repository is assumed to implement one of the recognized 
&quot;dictionary&quot; interfaces through which the runtime can issue lookup requests and 
retrieve responses.</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="screenshot_017.gif" width="646" height="159"></p>
<p>The last thing to note here is the &lt;ObjectClass&gt; element. This element 
specifies the class of the object that is expected to be retrieved from the 
repository. In this case, the class is again pre-defined, like it was the case 
for the type of values in the channel. Note that types can also have parameters. 
In this case, &quot;806C71E88E749AA879E52F960F4B881&quot; represents a generic type 
&quot;communication channel&quot; that can carry messages of type &quot;MessageClass&quot;, and 
supports state transfer of type &quot;CheckpointClass&quot;, where &quot;MessageClass&quot; and &quot;CheckpointClass&quot; 
are parameters to this template.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong><a name="analyzing"></a>Analyzing Objects with an Object Designer</strong></p>

illustrates the sequence of actions we will walk you through.</p>

</object>
</p>
<p>The use of 128-bit identifiers makes the XML files obscure, but with high 
probability guarantees that the names will be unique, and keeps the size of the 
object definitions predictable, since each identifier is limited to 16 bytes, or 
32 characters in an XML file. In practice, we don&#39;t expect the user to work with 
the XML files directly, hence we provide a visual designer. The designer is 
wrapped up as a live object (although at present, it does not support 
collaborative editing), and is started by executing &quot;object_designer.liveobject&quot; 
in the &quot;examples&quot; folder of the distribution. Start the designer and drag the 
file &quot;plane_subscriber_00.liveobject&quot; into the central area of the form that 
shows up. You should see something like the following.</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="screenshot_018.gif" width="991" height="215"></p>
<p>On the left, you see the object definition displayed in the form of a tree 
view. You can expand parts of the tree by clicking on the &quot;+&quot; signs. After 
expanding parts of the tree, you might see something like the following.</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="screenshot_019.gif" width="462" height="527"></p>
<p>The information displayed here is equivalent to that in the XML file, but the 
obscure 128-bit identifiers are resolved to actual objects and types, which are 
loaded from the respective libraries where necessary, and wherever the 
corresponding elements define human-readable names or descriptions, these are 
displayed instead of the identifiers. The full information about the object or 
type, including the identifier, can be obtained by moving the mouse over the 
corresponding element and inspecting the tooltip, as shown below.</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="screenshot_020.gif" width="479" height="110"></p>
<p>In the middle, selected aspects of the object definition are visualized in 
the form of a diagram, in which rounded rectangles of the sort shown above 
represent individual objects. You can zoom in and out of the diagram by using 
the mouse wheel, move the diagram by pressing and holding the mouse button on 
any part of it, moving the mouse to shift the view, and releasing it. You can 
also expand or collapse details of the diagram by double-clicking on the 
objects. After expanding all elements of the diagram by double-clicking on them, 
you would see something like the following.</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="screenshot_021.gif" width="783" height="890"></p>
<p>Clicking on a node on the tree or a part of the diagram highlights the 
corresponding element with a yellow background, both in the diagram as well as 
in the tree. In the picture shown above, a single object named &quot;Subscriber&quot; has 
been selected. Besides highlighting the object itself, the entire area 
corresponding to the definition of the selected object, including the parameters 
used to instantiate it from a template or a repository from which it is 
retrieved, is surrounded by a dotted line. You can see this in the above 
picture: the dotted line surrounds an area containing four objects with 
&quot;Subscriber&quot; at the top.</p>
<p>Selecting certain elements, besides highlighting them in yellow, also 
highlights other associated elements and connections with them in blue. For 
example, selecting a parameter also highlights the value assigned to this 
parameter. In the picture below, the object passed as a parameter &quot;channel&quot; to 
the &quot;Subscriber&quot; is highlighted this way.</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="screenshot_022.gif" width="941" height="520"></p>
<p>Now, let us focus on the diagram. Each rounded rectangle representing an 
object has a number of rectangular shapes on its sides. We will refer to those 
as &quot;ports&quot;. Pots on each side has a different purpose. The port at the top of 
the object represents the object itself. When the top port of an object X it is 
connected to a parameter port of object Y, it means that X is passed as a 
parameter to Y. The parameter ports are those at the bottom. In the diagram, 
only parameters that are object references are drawn. Parameters that are types 
or ordinary values are not present in the diagram, information about them can be 
found in the tree view on the left. The port on the left side of an object is 
present only in repository objects, and links the repository object to the 
repository from which it is retrieved. Finally, ports on the right represent the 
object&#39;s endpoints. In the section of the diagram shown below, the &quot;Subscriber&quot; 
object has a single parameter port that is connected to the top port 
representing the repository object &quot;00000000000000000000000000000003&quot;. As a 
repository obejct, the latter has a port on the left linking it to the top port 
of another repository object. Each of the objects shown here has a single 
endpoint. </p>
<p class="style2"><img src="screenshot_023.gif" width="794" height="664"></p>
<p>As it was the case with the tree view, the information about the parameters 
and endpoints is displayed in the tooltips when hovering over a portion of the 
diagram.</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="screenshot_024.gif" width="750" height="350"></p>
<p><strong><a name="modifying"></a>Modifying Existing Objects with the Object 
Designer</strong> </p>
<p>Once an object is loaded into the designer, parts of the object definition 
can be modified. The modifiable parts are displayed in a black font in the tree 
view. The grayed out portions represent parts of the object definition that are 
derived from other parts, or simply additional information, and cannot be 
directly modified. For example, the types of the object&#39;s endpoints are 
determined by the object&#39;s class, and the class of a predefined object is 
statically pre-determined by the definition stored in the library where the 
object is defined, hence these elements are grayed out. On the other hand, 
parameters and the &quot;from&quot; clauses are generally modifiable.</p>
<p>There are two ways to modify an element of the definition: by right-clicking 
on it and choosing &quot;Change Value&quot; from the context menu, or by dragging 
something onto it. The former is used to change simple values, such as numbers 
or strings, as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="screenshot_026.gif" width="461" height="144"></p>
<p>In the dialog that appears, we may specify the way the string is decoded. 
Most of the time, option &quot;text&quot; will be used, which invokes a method such as 
&quot;Parse&quot;, a constructor with a String argument, or a similar method of the 
underlying data type, if one is found. For more complex values, the &quot;xml&quot; option 
that constructs the value from the provided XMLbe more adequate. The value is 
accepted after pressing ENTER. If the string is not recognized, it will be 
colored in red, and the window will stay modal until a correct value is entered.</p>
<p><img src="screenshot_027.gif" width="445" height="170"></p>
<p>Dragging and dropping is used to replace parts of the definition that 
represent types or object references. Object references can be dragged as a text 
e.g. from notepad, or as a files with the &quot;liveobject&quot; extension. All types of 
elements can also be dragged from a library of known objects and types. The 
latter is shown in a tree view on the right side of the editor window, which 
after expanding may look as on the picture below. </p>
<p class="style2"><img src="screenshot_025.gif" width="289" height="266"></p>
<p>To test parameter replacement, expand the library node &quot;objects&quot;, select 
object template &quot;Text&quot;, dag it into the central window or the tree view, and 
drop it onto the parameter &quot;coordinates&quot; (the drop area will highlight as you 
move the mouse). You should see a new diagram, with some of the elements 
displayed in red. </p>
<p>The red color indicates that the definitions are incorrect. You can see the 
error details in the tooltip after hovering over the corresponding element. For 
example, hovering over the parameter &quot;coordinates&quot; should result display 
something that looks like the following.</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="screenshot_028.gif" width="959" height="450"></p>
<p>In this case, the type of the parameter and the actual value assigned to that 
parameter do not match. You can verify that yourself by expanding the 
corresponding elements in the tree. First, after expanding the &quot;ValueClass&quot; 
element of the parameter, you should see something like the following. </p>
<p class="style2"><img src="screenshot_029.gif" width="364" height="131"></p>
<p>This definition states that the type of the object that should be assigned to 
this parameter should be a stream of values of type &quot;coordinates&quot;. However, as 
the &quot;ObjectClass&quot; element of the &quot;Text&quot; object&nbsp; indicates, this object is a 
UI component. By expanding the list of endpoints, you can verify that the UI 
object has differently named endpoints of different types than objects of type 
value stream, and therefore UI objects are not usable in the context in which 
value streams are expected, hence the type mismatch.</p>
<p>We leave it up to you to experiment with the object designer. If you manage 
to produce an object that type-checks correctly, and has no elements highlighted 
in red, you can select the object in the tree view, drag it back e.g. onto the 
desktop, and use it.</p>

</object>
</p>
<p>To conclude this part of the tutorial, we will create an object from scratch 
by using template components from the library. To begin, open the designer 
window, expand the library view, and locate object &quot;desktop&quot; in the object list, 
then drag it onto the design sheet. The designer won&#39;t make the object as 
incorrect, even though it is a template object and none of the template 
arguments are set, because the object does not have any type parameters, and all 
non value parameters are by default assigned null. However, the object as it is 
won&#39;t run.</p>
<p>After expanding the parameters in the tree view, you should see something 
like the following.</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="screenshot_030.gif" width="1174" height="404"></p>
<p>We need to provide three parameters. The first is a background color, which 
you can set by using the &quot;Change Value&quot; option from the parameter context menu. 
Let&#39;s type in &quot;Blue&quot;. The second is a communication channel. Find an object 
named &quot;LocalCommunicationChannel&quot; in the &quot;objects&quot; section of the library, and 
drag it onto the parameter. This is a mock communication channel that offers an 
empty checkpoint to start with and bounces all messages back. After expanding 
the object in the central window by double-clicking it, you should see something 
like the following.</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="screenshot_031.gif" width="917" height="402"></p>
<p>The definitions are not correct. When you hover over the elements of the 
diagram or the nodes in the tree view marked in red, you will find that some of 
the parameters are not set. The local communication channel template has type 
parameters, and for those, there are no defaults, hence the error. Expand the 
channel object.</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="screenshot_032.gif" width="463" height="311">&nbsp; </p>
<p>Now, inspect the parameter description. The information in the tree view 
tells us that the parameter is a value, and that the class of this value is an 
object reference. The object passed as a reference should be a &quot;checkpointed 
communication channel&quot;, i.e. a channel that supports state transfer. As you can 
see, this type is parameterized by two value classes, the type of messages 
carried by the channel and the type of state that is transferred in the form of 
checkpoints. </p>
<p>First, let us set wrong values of the parameters, e.g. by dragging &quot;Desktop 
Operation&quot; value class from the library and dropping it onto both of these 
parameters. Note that the LocalCommunicationChannel object no longer reports the 
error. The object is now well defined. However, the parameter is still reporting 
an error, because the type of the object is invalid.</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="screenshot_033.gif" width="456" height="308"></p>
<p>To fix this, drag value class &quot;Desktop State&quot; from the library onto the &quot;CheckpointClass&quot; 
parameter. The parameter is accepted now, and the entire definition is correct 
again.</p>
<p>Finally, set the value of the third parameter, &quot;loader&quot;, by dragging a 
&quot;Loader&quot; object from the library. The &quot;loader&quot; object in this case is used by 
the desktop to load object references from XML files. The loader itself has a 
parameter &quot;library&quot;, which points to a library manager object that the loader 
should use to resolve the 128-bit object and type identifiers encountered in the 
XML definitions. Again, drag object &quot;Library&quot; from the library onto the 
parameter. You should end up with something that after expanding looks like the 
following.</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="screenshot_034.gif" ></p>
<p>Now, you can grab the top node labeled &quot;Predefined Object &quot;Desktop&quot;&quot; in the 
tree view, drag it out of the designer and onto your desktop, and double-click 
to launch the object. You should see a new instance of the desktop running. You 
can drag objects from the &quot;examples&quot; folder onto it.</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="screenshot_035.gif" width="382" height="215"> </p>
<p>As an exercise, try to now drag the desktop object you created back into the 
designer, and replace the mock communication channel it uses with a real one 
that you will extract from a desktop object &quot;shared_desktop_1.liveobject&quot; in the 
&quot;examples&quot; folder. To achieve this, you should first drag the 
&quot;shared_desktop_1.liveobject&quot; file into the designer, select the communication 
channel it uses and drag it out of the designer onto the desktop, then drag the 
desktop object you previously created into the designer, and drag the channel 
saved on the desktop onto the &quot;channel&quot; parameter to replace its current value. 
You should end up with your brand new blue desktop connected to the same channel 
as the desktop in the &quot;examples&quot; folder, but with a differently colored 
background. Make sure that the service process is running, then launch both 
objects, and verify that their contents stay synchronized.</p>
