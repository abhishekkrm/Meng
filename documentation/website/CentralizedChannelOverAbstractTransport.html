<h1>Live Distributed Objects</h1>
<h2>Working with Centralized Channel Over TCP Transport2 Components</h2>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal"><FONT SIZE=3> The component is configured to use simple transport like Tcp Transport2 to build centralized server with a checkpointed communication channel (CC), that can accept connections from CC's clients. The server listens on a known port 42424 and clients connect to it. Whenever server gets new connections it ask for checkpoint from a component and relays it to the new connecting client. The server also relays messages to everyone connected. 
<h4><b>Example</b></h4>
CentalizedChannelOverAbstractTransportServer.liveobject is the server object and CentalizedChannelOverAbstractTransportClient.liveobjects is the client object.
&ldquo;CentalizedChannelOverAbstractTransport_&rdquo; component uses TcpTransport2_ component to abstract the TCP connection functionality.  TcpTransport2_ typical accept ip:port combinations, but also allows you to specify a subnet you wish to listen on.  For our purposes, anything will do, so we listen on 0.0.0.0/0:42424 (any subnet).  The port is this case is 42424.
The &ldquo;Text&rdquo; component connected to &ldquo;CentalizedChannelOverAbstractTransport&rdquo; component is basically used for checkpointing. Whenever server gets new connections it ask for checkpoint from "Text" component and relays it to the new connecting client.

&ldquo;CentalizedChannelOverAbstractTransportClient1_&rdquo; component also uses TcpTransport2_ component to abstract the TCP connection functionality. &ldquo;Text&rdquo; component is used to send user messages to the server and display the messages received back from the server.

<OL>
<LI> Start single instance of CentalizedChannelOverAbstractTransportServer.liveobject (server) object.
<LI> Open multiple instances of CentalizedChannelOverAbstractTransportClient.liveobjects (client) object.
<LI> Messages typed in one clients are relayed to every client connected by the server.
<LI> Close all the instances of the client. 
<LI> Open new clients. The checkpointed state will be relayed to the new clients.
