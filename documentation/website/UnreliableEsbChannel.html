<h1>Live Distributed Objects</h1>
<h2>Using UnreliableEsbChannel using JBoss ESB</h2>
<P><FONT SIZE=3><B>Basic Setup and Functionality</B></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal"><FONT SIZE=3>The following steps will
get you started with using a live object to send messages via an ESB 
channel. As of now, messages only get sent, the receiving part of the 
communication is under progress. </FONT></P>

	<LI><P STYLE="font-weight: normal"><FONT SIZE=3>Please ensure you have JDK 5 
	(v1.5.0_06 is recommended, I am using 1.6.0_13) and Ant (v1.6.5) installed on your system.
	Start by downloading
	JBoss ESB 4.5 from <A HREF="http://labs.jboss.com/jbossesb/downloads/">Esb download</A>. Choose
	to download "jbossesb-4.6.zip". Next download the JBoss ESB App Server from
	<A HREF="http://www.jboss.org/jbossas/">Esb AS Download</A>. Choose to download "5.1.0.GA". Unzip both
	of these to say C:\ on windows. So you will end up with folder structres like
	C:\jbossesb-4.6 (ESB Home) and C:\jboss-5.1.0.GA (AS Home) respectively.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="font-weight: normal"><FONT SIZE=3>Go to C:\jbossesb-4.6\install and edit the
	deployment.properties by specifying the AS Home at org.jboss.esb.server.home. So basically,
	the line now reads as "org.jboss.esb.server.home=C:\jboss-5.1.0.GA".</FONT></P>
	<LI><P><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">Next, download jms_router_sender.zip from TODO into
	C:\jbossesb-4.6\samples\quickstarts. So you have the structure C:\jbossesb-4.6\samples\quickstarts\unzip\jms_router_sender.
	This has the code that listens for requests coming from a live object to disseminate messages through the Esb Channel.
	</SPAN></FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="font-weight: normal"><FONT SIZE=3>Now, open a command prompt and 
	run the bat file run.bat found in C:\jboss-5.1.0.GA\bin. This will start your 
	JBoss AS. Now, we need to deploy the jms_router_sender code. Open another command prompt
	and change directory to C:\jbossesb-4.6\samples\quickstarts\unzip\jms_router_sender.
	Deploy the code by typing in "ant deploy" and see if your build succeeded.
	After this, type in ant runsender. This will start the code that will be sending messages 
	to the JMS Message Queue Gateway. In another command prompt window, change directory to 
	C:\jbossesb-4.6\samples\quickstarts\unzip\jms_router_sender and type in "ant runreceiver".
	This will simply output all messages received on the receiving Queue. These are the messages
	that will then be passed on to other liveobject instances using this channel in the second part
	of my work.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="font-weight: normal"><FONT SIZE=3>Now, open TestEsb.liveobject and type in some text.
	You should see the same text being received on the 3rd window opened in the step above.</FONT></P>
