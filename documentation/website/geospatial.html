<h1>Live Distributed Objects</h1>
<h2>Working with Geo-Spatial
Components</h2>
<P><FONT SIZE=3><B>Basic Setup and Functionality</B></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal"><FONT SIZE=3>The following steps will
get you started with using the basic functionality of the spatial
components such as maps (provided by MSN Virtual Earth). We assume
the user has become familiar with live objects such as shared folders
and examining them using the object designer (described in the
previous sections of this documentation).</FONT></P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="font-weight: normal"><FONT SIZE=3>Open (by
	double-clicking) the channels_server live object found in the
	examples directory of your installation.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="font-weight: normal"><FONT SIZE=3>Open the
	xna_window_freestyle live object found in the GeoDiscovery directory.
	This window displays all spatial objects. Nothing should be
	displayed in the window yet, because we have not added any content
	to it. This window live object has a shared folder as a parameter,
	as you can see if you examine it in the object designer. It displays
	the content from objects that are put into that folder. So we need
	to put a map source object into the shared folder.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">In order for
	you to use our map source objects you must have an MSN Virtual Earth
	Platform Developer Account in order to be able access the online
	maps. Follow <A HREF="https://mappoint-css.live.com/MwsSignup/">this
	link</A> to sign up for free and start using the map source objects.</SPAN></FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="font-weight: normal"><FONT SIZE=3>After you have
	obtained an account, you need to put your credentials (username and
	password) as parameter to the map_aerial / map_road / map_traffic
	live objects. You can do that either by editing the XML of the live
	object directly (you only need to add a few lines) or editing the
	object in the object designer. If you would like to user the object
	designer and visually input your credentials, you can follow the
	video tutorial in our <A href="geospatial_tutorials.html">Geospatial
	Video Tutorials</A> section.  The first way is simpler and faster
	in this simple case though. Below is a sample XML file with the
	changed/added lines highlighted. Note that you must also enter a
	subnet value, which is the subnet of the IP address you want to use
	when connecting to the internet. If you are not sure what this is,
	just enter the default &ldquo;0.0.0.0/0&rdquo; (without the quotes).</FONT></P>

	shared_folder1_view live object (also found there). Now drag the
	saved live object file that you just edited into the folder view
	window. You should see that maps will start loading in your XNA
	window.</FONT></P>
